## Determining Magnification Factors from Luminosity vs FWHM Relations of CO Rotation lines in SMG Galaxies

### Absract

In this report we investigate CO line luminosities vs FWHM relations for SMG galaxies and determine their accuracy in deriving gravitational lensing factors. Analysis of CO J:1-2 and J:3-2 lines yield possible trends in accuracy of using such relations to determine magnification factors, by comparison to factors found in the literature. Power-law fits and derived magnification factors are compared with Harris et al (2012), highlighting the sensitivity of this method to small sample sizes. Further lines of analysis of CO vs FWHM plots are suggested and the need for collaboration to compile a larger sample of sources is highlighted.
